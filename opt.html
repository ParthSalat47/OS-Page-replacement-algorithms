		<h2>Optimal (OPT)</h2>
			<p><span>>></span> In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="text-dark"><span>>></span> Example : Consider the page references 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, with 4 page frame. Find number of page fault.</p>
			<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190412160500/optimal.png">
			<p><span>>></span> Initially all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots —> 4 Page faults.</p>
			<p><span>>></span> 0 is already their so —> 0 Page fault.</p>
			<p><span>>></span> when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is not used for the longest duration of time in the future.—>1 Page fault.</p>
			<p><span>>></span> 0 is already there so —> 0 Page fault.</p>
			<p><span>>></span> 4 will takes place of 1 —> 1 Page Fault.</p>
			<p><span>>></span> Now for the further page reference string —> 0 Page fault because they are already available in the memory.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">NOTE :</span> Optimal page replacement is perfect, but not possible in practice as the operating system cannot know future requests. The use of Optimal Page replacement is to set up a benchmark so that other replacement algorithms can be analyzed against it.</p>
